# Monzo Dashboard
This project delivers a strategic dashboard built for Monzo Bank to support high-level decision-making across HR and business functions. Designed using Python, the dashboard visualizes key metrics such as employee attrition, departmental satisfaction, customer growth, and financial liabilities. It aligns with frameworks like the Balanced Scorecard and McKinsey 7S, translating complex data into clear, actionable insights. With a focus on clarity, accessibility, and strategic alignment, the dashboard equips Monzoâ€™s leadership with a dynamic tool to monitor performance, anticipate risks, and drive evidence-based decisions.
